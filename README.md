Welcome to my profile! I'm Joaquin, also known as Jun/Peri. I'm a Peruvian developer that works on stuff in Python, NodeJS, C and dotNet.

I have my own company: Master Plan Studios, which specializes in game development. Currently there's some projects in concept phase, so have patience.

I mainly use Linux as a main OS, and use MacOS as a fallback. Yes, f*** Recall.

I go by any pronouns, I don't care.
